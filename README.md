#  <h1 align="center">üëã Hi there, I‚Äôm Raheem Lee.</h1>

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a graduate from Georgia State University with a passion for data analytics. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis, data cleaning, and programming languages such as SQL and Python.

In this portfolio, you will find projects that showcase my skills in:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Examples of transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
- Data Visualization: Creating compelling visual stories using tools like Tableau.
- Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to uncover trends and patterns.
- Database Management: Designing and managing relational databases.

I am eager to bring my analytical skills and attention to detail to an entry-level data analyst role, where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and continue to grow my expertise.
